# 📚 How to Create a GitHub Portfolio

## _[In Progress]_

Hi there, I'm Katie! 🙋🏻‍♀️

This is a fuss-free, simple guide to create your GitHub portfolio. 

It's perfect for
- Beginners in data science who wants to showcase samples of work, or projects.
- Serves as a digital resume and proof you have the skills in your resume. 
- A fun way to keep track of your projects.
- You do not need to understand how to code to do this, trust me. I'm a non-coder myself.

## Introduction 

Let's understand some of the alien terms that you will see on GitHub.

`Repository/repo` means `folder`. It is similar to creating folders on your computer. Each repository represents one folder. You can create multiple repositories for different projects. 

`README.md` is a default note, or summary that is usually included in each repo. It acts as the "homepage" of your repo where you can introduce the project,  provide a summary, or anything - so feel free to write it.

**Why I created this repo?**
- I was once intimidated by GitHub myself. I signed up for an account in July and left it aside as I did not understand how it works.
- Since then, I learnt how to use it (I'm quite obsessed with repos now 😆), so I would love to share this knowledge with everyone. 🙂

## How to Create Your Profile?

**Are you interested in creating a Profile that appears on your GitHub homepage, _like mine_?**

**1. Click on `New Repository` on top right of the page.**

**2. Next, create a new repository with the _exact name as your username_.**

My username is "**katiehuangx**", so I created a new repository "**katiehuangx**". This repository will contain the write-up of your profile.

The format of the profile is a `Markdown (.md)` file. The default name is `README.md` so you can leave it as that.

**3. To edit a Markdown file, hover over the pencil ✏️ icon and click `Edit this file`.**

**Now you can start to write your profile! 😄**

### What to write in your profile?

It's entirely up to you and your creativity! Most people would include:
- Introduction
- Skills (i.e. Data Analysis, SQL, Python, Tableau, etc)
- Fancier things (i.e. visitor count, preview of other websites, etc
- Projects that you're proud of

## How to Create New Repository?

Creating a new repo is as easy as creating your profile.

**1. Firstly, click on `New Repository` on top right of the page. **

<img width="257" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135068335-12538e85-8090-4f27-8232-47bfcc15b2c2.png">

This is the default setting. If you forgot to tick `Add a README.md`, you can create it in the repo itself later.

And, it's done. You have created your first repo! 

### Extra: How to Create Subfolders in your Repository?

**1. Navigate to the right side of the page, click `Add File` and `Create New File`.**

**2. `Name your file` followed by the extension `.md`, `.sql`, or any format.**
