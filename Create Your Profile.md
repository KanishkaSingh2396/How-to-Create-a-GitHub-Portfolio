It's entirely up to you and your creativity! Most people would include
- Introduction
- Skills (i.e. Data Analysis, SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel, etc)
- Fancier things (i.e. visitor count, preview of other websites, etc (I will not teach this as I'm not good in techy stuffs ðŸ˜†)
- Social media accounts
- Projects you're proud of! ðŸ˜„
